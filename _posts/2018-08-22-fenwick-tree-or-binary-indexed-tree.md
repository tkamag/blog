#### Complexity Analysis

* Space: `O(n)`
* Time:
    * Search: `O(logn)`
    * Update: `O(logn)`
    * Create: `O(n logn)`

#### How to get Parent?

1. 2's complement
2. AND "`&`" with original number
3. Add it to original number

update tree:

```java
while (i <= n) {
    i += lowbit(i);
    // update tree
    ...
}
```

where `lowbit()` is a function which you can extract the lower bit from an integer:

```java
-x = ~x + 1

lowbit(x) = x & (-x)
```

For example:

```java
x = 5                  = 0110
-x = ~x + 1 = 1001 + 1 = 1010
lowbit(x)              = 0010
```

so add it back to original number `0010 + 0110 = 1000 = 8`, `8` will be the parent of `5`


#### How to get Next?

1. 2's complement
2. AND "`&`" with original number
3. Add it to original number


query tree:

```java
while (i > 0) {
    i -= lowbit(i);
    // update tree
    ...
}
```


### Binary Indexed Tree or Fenwick Tree \[GeeksforGeeks\]

Let us consider the following problem to understand **Binary Indexed Tree**.

We have an array `arr[0 . . . n-1]`. We should be able to

1. Find the sum of first i elements.
2. Change value of a specified element of the array `arr[i] = x` where `0 <= i <= n-1`.

A **simple solution** is to run a loop from `0` to `i-1` and calculate sum of elements. To update a value, simply do `arr[i] = x`. The first operation takes `O(n)` time and second operation takes `O(1)` time. Another simple solution is to create another array and store sum from start to i at the i‘th index in this array. Sum of a given range can now be calculated in `O(1)` time, but update operation takes `O(n)` time now. This works well if the number of query operations are large and very few updates.

**Can we perform both the operations in O\(log n\) time once given the array?**   
One Efficient Solution is to use [Segment Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-sum-of-given-range/) that does both operations in `O(Logn)` time.

_Using Binary Indexed Tree, we can do both tasks in `O(Logn)`time. The advantages of Binary Indexed Tree over Segment are, requires less space and very easy to implement._.

#### Representation

Binary Indexed Tree is represented as an array. Let the array be `BITree[]`. Each node of Binary Indexed Tree stores sum of some elements of given array. Size of Binary Indexed Tree is equal to `n` where `n` is size of input array. In the below code, we have used size as `n+1` for ease of implementation.

#### Construction

We construct the Binary Indexed Tree by first initializing all values in `BITree[]` as `0`. Then we call `update()` operation for all indexes to store actual sums, update is discussed below.

#### Operations

**`getSum(index)`**

```text
getSum(index): Returns sum of arr[0..index]
// Returns sum of arr[0..index] using BITree[0..n].  It assumes that
// BITree[] is constructed for given array arr[0..n-1]
1) Initialize sum as 0 and index as index+1.
2) Do following while index is greater than 0.
...a) Add BITree[index] to sum
...b) Go to parent of BITree[index].  Parent can be obtained by removing
      the last set bit from index, i.e., index = index - (index & (-index))
3) Return sum.
```

1. Node at index `0` is a **dummy node**.
2. A node at index `y` is parent of a node at index `x`, **iff `y` can be obtained by removing last set bit from binary representation of `x`**.
3. A child `x` of a node `y` stores **sum of elements** from of `y` \(exclusive `y`\) and of `x` \(inclusive `x`\).

**`update(index, val)`**

```text
update(index, val): Updates BIT for operation arr[index] += val
// Note that arr[] is not changed here.  It changes
// only BI Tree for the already made change in arr[].
1) Initialize index as index+1.
2) Do following while index is smaller than or equal to n.
...a) Add value to BITree[index]
...b) Go to parent of BITree[index].  Parent can be obtained by removing
      the last set bit from index, i.e., index = index + (index & (-index))
```

<img src="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/BITUpdate12.png" width="70%">


The update process needs to make sure that all BITree nodes that have `arr[i]` as part of the section they cover must be updated. We get all such nodes of BITree by repeatedly adding the decimal number corresponding to the last set bit.

#### How does Binary Indexed Tree work?

The idea is based on the fact that **all positive integers can be represented as sum of powers of 2**. 

For example 19 can be represented as 16 + 2 + 1. Every node of BI Tree stores sum of `n` elements where `n` is a power of `2`. For example, in the above first diagram for `getSum()`, sum of first `12` elements can be obtained by sum of last `4` elements \(from `9` to `12`\) plus sum of `8` elements \(from `1` to `8`\). The number of set bits in binary representation of a number `n` is `O(Logn)`. 

Therefore, we traverse at-most `O(Logn)` nodes in both `getSum()` and `update()` operations. Time complexity of construction is `O(nLogn)` as it calls `update()` for all n elements.

**Implementation:**  
Following are the implementations of Binary Indexed Tree.

```java
// Java program to demonstrate lazy 
// propagation in segment tree
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;
 
class BinaryIndexedTree
{   
    // Max tree size
    final static int MAX = 1000;        
 
    static int BITree[] = new int[MAX];
     
    /* n  --> No. of elements present in input array.   
    BITree[0..n] --> Array that represents Binary 
                     Indexed Tree.
    arr[0..n-1]  --> Input array for whic prefix sum 
                     is evaluated. */
 
    // Returns sum of arr[0..index]. This function 
    // assumes that the array is preprocessed and 
    // partial sums of array elements are stored 
    // in BITree[].
    int getSum(int index)
    {
        int sum = 0; // Iniialize result
      
        // index in BITree[] is 1 more than
        // the index in arr[]
        index = index + 1;
      
        // Traverse ancestors of BITree[index]
        while(index>0)
        {
            // Add current element of BITree 
            // to sum
            sum += BITree[index];
      
            // Move index to parent node in 
            // getSum View
            index -= index & (-index);
        }
        return sum;
    }
 
    // Updates a node in Binary Index Tree (BITree)
    // at given index in BITree.  The given value 
    // 'val' is added to BITree[i] and all of 
    // its ancestors in tree.
    public static void updateBIT(int n, int index, 
                                        int val)
    {
        // index in BITree[] is 1 more than 
        // the index in arr[]
        index = index + 1;
      
        // Traverse all ancestors and add 'val'
        while(index <= n)
        {
           // Add 'val' to current node of BIT Tree
           BITree[index] += val;
      
           // Update index to that of parent 
           // in update View
           index += index & (-index);
        }
    }
 
    /* Function to construct fenwick tree 
     from given array.*/
    void constructBITree(int arr[], int n)
    {
        // Initialize BITree[] as 0
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++)
            BITree[i] = 0;
      
        // Store the actual values in BITree[]
        // using update()
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            updateBIT(n, i, arr[i]);
    }
 
    // Main function
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int freq[] = {2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 
                      4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
        int n = freq.length;
        BinaryIndexedTree tree = new BinaryIndexedTree();
  
        // Build fenwick tree from given array
        tree.constructBITree(freq, n);
  
        System.out.println("Sum of elements in arr[0..5]"+
                           " is = "+ tree.getSum(5));
         
        // Let use test the update operation
        freq[3] += 6;
         
        // Update BIT for above change in arr[]
        updateBIT(n, 3, 6); 
  
        // Find sum after the value is updated
        System.out.println("Sum of elements in arr[0..5]"+
                       " after update is = " + tree.getSum(5));
    }
}
 
// This code is contributed by Ranjan Binwani
```

Output:

```text
Sum of elements in arr[0..5] is 12
Sum of elements in arr[0..5] after update is 18
```

**Can we extend the Binary Indexed Tree for range Sum in Logn time?**  
This is simple to answer. The `rangeSum(l, r)` can be obtained as `getSum(r) – getSum(l-1)`.

**Applications:**  
Used to implement the arithmetic coding algorithm. Development of operations it supports were primarily motivated by use in that case. See [this ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenwick_tree#Applications)for more details.
